# array-codes
Given a sorted array A of size N and a target value B, return the index (0-based indexing) if the target is found.
If not, return the index where it would be if it were inserted in order.

NOTE: You may assume no duplicates in the array. Users are expected to solve this in O(log(N)) time.

public class Solution {
    public int searchInsert(int[] A, int B) {
   int last = 0;
    int right = A.length-1;
    while(last<=right){
        int mid = (last + right)/2;
        if(B==A[mid]){
            return mid;
        }
        if(B<A[mid]){
            right = (mid-1);
        }
        else {
            last = (mid +1);
        }
       
    }
    return last;
    }
}
